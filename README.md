This repository contains a detailed set of manual test cases for the Google Chrome web browser, covering a wide range of functional, UI, network, performance, and security aspects. These test cases are designed to help QA engineers, testers, or enthusiasts validate Chromeâ€™s core features and ensure consistent behavior across use cases. Each test case includes a unique Test Case ID, clear test steps, expected and actual results, and pass/fail status to maintain traceability and reporting.

The test suite includes scenarios such as opening websites, tab management, bookmarks, downloads, incognito browsing, inspecting responsiveness, and checking browser storage like cookies and cache. It also considers negative testing like invalid URL entry, offline behavior, and accessing restricted websites. Testing was performed manually on the latest version of Chrome under standard system conditions.

This documentation aims to provide a quick reference for those who want to perform cross-browser testing, troubleshoot Chrome behavior, or build further automated test scripts using tools like Selenium or Cypress. You can use this test suite as a base for browser compatibility or regression testing in your web applications.

Feel free to fork, clone, or contribute to this repository to extend the test cases or adapt them for other browsers such as Firefox, Edge, or Safari.
