Google Chrome is one of the most widely used web browsers, known for its speed, security, and user-friendly interface. To ensure its reliability and efficiency, it is essential to conduct thorough testing. This document outlines various test cases that help verify Chrome’s core functionalities, performance, and security features.

The test cases begin with basic operations such as launching the Chrome browser and verifying if it opens without errors. Website accessibility is tested by entering a URL and checking whether the page loads correctly. Performance is assessed by measuring page load speed to ensure it meets user expectations. The back and forward navigation functionality is also tested to confirm seamless browsing.

Security and privacy-related test cases include testing incognito mode, ensuring that browsing history and cookies are not stored. The browser’s ability to block pop-ups is checked to confirm that intrusive advertisements and malicious content are prevented. Additionally, autofill functionality is tested to verify that stored user credentials and form data populate correctly.

File handling capabilities are assessed by downloading and uploading files, ensuring smooth interaction with local storage. Bookmarking functionality is tested to confirm that users can save and access their favorite web pages easily.
